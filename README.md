🩸 Bloods-Connect

A responsive web app to quickly find and connect blood donors in your local area

🚀 Project Overview

Bloods-Connect enables people in urgent need of blood (or those who wish to donate) to connect seamlessly:

Donors can register their details (blood group, location, contact) and mark themselves as available.

Seekers can search for potential donors by blood group and location, view matches, and send connect requests.

Built for fast access during emergencies and for everyday donor-matching to help communities stay prepared.
